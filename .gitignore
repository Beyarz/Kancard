# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal
/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/storage/*
!/storage/.keep

/public/assets
.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key

/public/packs
/public/packs-test
/node_modules
/yarn-error.log
yarn-debug.log*
.yarn-integrity

# TODO Comment out this rule if you are OK with secrets being uploaded to the repo
config/initializers/secret_token.rb
config/master.key

# Only include if you have production secrets in this file, which is no longer a Rails default
# config/secrets.yml

# dotenv
# TODO Comment out this rule if environment variables can be committed
.env

## Environment normalization:
/vendor/bundle

# these should all be checked in to normalize the environment:
# Gemfile.lock, .ruby-version, .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

# if using bower-rails ignore default bower_components path bower.json files
/vendor/assets/bower_components
*.bowerrc
bower.json

# Ignore pow environment settings
.powenv

# Ignore Byebug command history file.

# Ignore node_modules
node_modules/

# Ignore precompiled javascript packs

# Ignore yarn files

# Ignore uploaded files in development

## Specific to RubyMotion (use of CocoaPods):
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control
# vendor/Pods/

## Documentation cache and generated files:
/.yardoc/
/_yardoc/
/doc/
/rdoc/

/.bundle/
/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

### Ruby Patch ###
# Used by RuboCop. Remote config files pulled in from inherit_from directive.
# .rubocop-https?--*
